This project implements a Java class named ThemeParkADT to manage visitor information in a theme park. It allows you to:

Read visitor data (first and last name, region, pass type, phone number, visit order) from a file.
Search for visitors by last name.
Find the number of regions.
Identify the most popular region (by total visitors).
Determine the number of VIP visitors from a specific region.
Locate VIP visitors in the park (shows their current location in the order they visit the kingdoms).
Check if two VIP visitors are in the same location (and belong to the same region).
Check if two regular visitors from the same region have the same order of visiting the kingdoms.
